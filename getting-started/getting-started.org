* Getting Started

Following the Python tutorial I will try to achieve the same. But at this point
I will have to start a folder structure for my examples.

Also I need to try creation of a separate project

[[https://wiki.haskell.org/How_to_write_a_Haskell_program][How to write a Haskell program]] has a section called Structure of a simple
project. We will adapt it to our needs.

We need to create two folders for our examples. But that will be done tomorrow.
