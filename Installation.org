* Installation
The first step involves installation of development libraries needed for our code.
I will try to give instructions for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system)][Ubuntu]] and [[http://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]].
** Ubuntu
Hopefully Haskell platform that comes with the system should work, However I
use one of previous versions of Haskell Platform. Also you have to install
~libgtk-3-dev~

TODO
** MSYS2
On Windows with MSYS2 you need to install specific version of GHC for my
examples to work. This gist has more instructions.

Also you need to install at least ~mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3~
