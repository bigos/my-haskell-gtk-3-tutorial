* My Haskell GTK+3 tutorial
This is work in progress for learning GTK+ and Haskell. It is inspired by [[http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][The Python GTK+3 Tutorial]]

It is based on my previous experiment [[https://github.com/bigos/gatakawa][Gatakawa]] and is intended for easy running
the examples and will try to be compatible with Ubuntu 16.04 if possible.

** Project structure
The org files will contain the instructions and code snippets that should let
the user do everything on his own, just following the instructions. That means
the user will be responsible for creation of the additional folders for the
projects. The instructions should be clear about it.
