* My Haskell GTK+3 tutorial
This is work in progress for learning GTK+ and Haskell. It is inspired by [[http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][The Python GTK+3 Tutorial]]

It is based on my previous experiment [[http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Gatakawa]] and is intended for easy running
the examples and will try to be compatible with Ubuntu 16.04 if possible.
